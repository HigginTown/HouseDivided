This dataset includes "79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa." The competition "challenges you to predict the final price of each home."
At this point, we should start to think about what we know about housing prices, [Ames, Iowa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ames,_Iowa), and what we might expect to see in this dataset. My instincts are that features like total square footage and year might play a role in the final price  of each home. Other aspects of the home, such as pools, fences, and zoning probably also influence the final price. We'll have a chance to explore the data and to supplmenent our instincts with machine learning and mathematics. 


Each competition might [evaluate](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques#evaluation) the submissions differently. Similarly, there can be differences in  the structure of your submission  file. 

In this challenge, we'll create a csv file that has onle column of Id's from the test data, and another column of predictions from our model. The Kaggle will calculate the [Root-Mean-Squared-Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation) and rank our submission on the [Public Leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/leaderboard).
