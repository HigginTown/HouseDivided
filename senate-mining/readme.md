THESE ARE FILES FROM A [DIFFERENT PROJECT](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~jakulin/Politics/)

Above is the 2003 Project which inspired my current analysis. My methods are different and make use of many contemporary tools and libraries. Further, they do not attempt to answer some of the same questions as I do in this project. 
Nonetheless, I followed their conceptual lead on building out the distance metric and, roughly, the cliustering process. 


To run their scripts, you will need:
* Orange (http://www.ailab.si/orange/ -- take the most recent version off CVS)
* Piddle

Note: I haven't run any of the code in this folder, but thought it was important to include in order to give full credit to the authors for their ideas and to draw the relevant distinctions between what we accomplished.
